# My Test
Fork the BigCommerce Cornerstone theme and use the Stencil CLI for local development

My store's preview code: hzmkj4ih6y

# Tasks
1) Create a product called Special Item assigned to a new category called Special Items.  Make sure Special Item has at least two images associated with it.
2) On hover of Special Item within the category page, have the second image display.
3) Create an "Add All to Cart" button at the top of the category page.  When clicked, add Special Item to the cart and notify the user that the product has been added.
4) If items are in the cart, show a button that says "Remove All Items" that will clear the cart.
5) Both buttons should utilize the Storefront API for completion.
6 - Bonus) If a customer is logged in display some of their customer details at the top of the category page.
7) Update the README.md file with a description of the test.

# Results
I've used Handlebars before so I started wtih the bonus feature of displaying customer details.  
When I started working on the product hover I began realizing how challenging and not-as-upfront as I expected this coding test to be.
I'm still confused about what I'm doing wrong since I can't get the image to change as expected.

When I started working on the cart buttons I was surprised again by unexpected hurdles, even with the documentation and developer community posts. I feel like my code is much messier and inefficient than I normally feel comfortable with.  If I were on a team where this kind of work was expected I would eagerly have reached out for help with best practices in working with BigCommerce, Stencil CLI, and the Storefront API from a more experienced developer.  I feel like I'm a 30 minute conversation with a subject matter expert way from fully completing the challenge tasks as well as significantly improved code.
